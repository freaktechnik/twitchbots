<h1 class="mt-3">About this service</h1>
<p class="lead">twitchbots.info is a service that tries to collect all moderator and other service bots used in chats on <a href="https://twitch.tv" rel="external noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>. It is run independently and developed as a hobby project.</p>
<p>The main reason to collect accounts that are used as bots is to identify them as bots in Twitch chat clients. Another use case is bots that distribute points, which can ignore other bots using this directory.</p>
